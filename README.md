#Install OpenAI Gym
git clone https://github.com/openai/gym  
cd gym  
pip install -e . # minimal install  
#Install MuJoco by following instructions on https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py Note: the binary download link on the page no longer #works. Download the binary at https://www.roboti.us/download/mjpro131_linux.zip 
#MuJoco gives 1-month free trailtrial per computer ID per email per year. We probably need to run VM as a walkaround.
